        We are exploring the feasibility of a furniture upcycling service where customers can return their used IKEA furniture for refurbishment, redesign, or recycling. The upcycled items would either be resold or given back to the original owner after enhancement. The initiative targets eco-conscious customers and aligns with IKEAâ€™s sustainability goals. Key focus areas include promoting circular economy, minimizing waste, and creating a new revenue stream.
        Key Focus Areas:
        - Developing a scalable logistics process for furniture returns and refurbishment.
        - Leveraging modular design to ease the upcycling process.
        - Promoting customer incentives like discounts or loyalty programs for returned furniture."""
